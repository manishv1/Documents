How to search package using apt:

sudo apt-get update  //   Update the cache lists stored in /var/lib/apt/lists
sudo apt-get upgrade //  Upgrade all software on your system 
apt-cache search < software/package name >
apt-cache show < Softwarw name>
apt-get install < Softwarw name >  // install software 

apt-get remove < Software Name>   // remove software mackage 
// but above command does not remove the package completely , configuration files are still left over with above command. This command is useful when you want to re insrall the software again with old configuration.

To remove the software along  with configuration file we use 

sudo apt-get purge < Package Namw>  //This command deletes package along with configuration file.

So always use purge command to remove software.


Some time for a package to work we need additional package as dependent package. 
They remain in system even if the packages required additional package is removed.
Such packages are reoved via command 

sudo apt-get autoremove
